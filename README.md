# cryo-EM-bash-scripts
These scripts can be used to monitor cryo-em jobs when using the RELION pipeline.
Bits of some of the scripts presented here were co-edited with my colleague David J. Filman and myself.
The classdist.sh and classdist_script.sh have to be used in conjunction with each other. The former does the table plotting of the relevant data from the star files using some RELION's in-built tools whereas the latter, functions as the interactive face of the script.
